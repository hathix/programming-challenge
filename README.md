# Neel's Programming Challenge

A fun game for learning object-oriented programming (it's not as scary as it sounds). A great challenge for young and old alike.


## About
I designed this game for our intermediate school's STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics day) as a hands-on part of the Robotics Club's presentation. It was surprisingly popular.

By the way, roughly 30% of people could solve this on their first try without any help. Are you one of them? Try it out!

The current version is in pretty good shape, but if you want to make an alternate version - with different objects and methods - feel free to submit a pull request with a new index.html and main.js file.
